# BadApple to ASCII

This repository contains a Python program that converts a video (BadApple in this case) into an ASCII art representation in real-time. Inspired by the repository [ascii-webcam](https://github.com/michael-dm/ascii-webcam), this project focuses on bringing that concept to a static video file for visual fun.

## Description

"BadApple to ASCII" is a simple Python script that reads the video file `video.mp4` and displays each frame as an ASCII art on the terminal. It's perfect for turning the iconic Bad Apple video into a unique art form that can be enjoyed in a retro and minimalistic way.

## Features
- Converts video frames to ASCII art.
- Can display the video in a terminal in real time.
- Simple Python implementation, easy to modify for other videos.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6+).

You will also need to install some dependencies. You can do that by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UnTanukii/badapple-to-ascii.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
cd badapple-to-ascii
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the `video.mp4` file (BadApple video) and place it in the repository directory.

## Usage

To run the script and start the conversion process, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

The video will start to play frame by frame, converting each frame into ASCII art that is printed to your terminal.
